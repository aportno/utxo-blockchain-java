## Chapter 1 :: Blockchain: A New Technology Paradigm
The fundamental requirements of a blockchain include security (cryptography), distributed (decentralized) network, and 
concurrency.

Within a blockchain network, there are different types of nodes:
* Miners - most interested in blocks to sustain the validation of growth of the blockchain
* Wallets - only utilize the blockchain system for trade, and not interested in mining
* Regional centers - providing services to wallets and some miners

Basic life cycle of a block:
1) Nodes initiate & broadcast transactions
2) Nodes collect & validate transactions
3) Each node constructs & mines a block
4) Nodes broadcast blocks
5) Only one block wins by consensus
6) Block is chained to the end of the blockchain
